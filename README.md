05/05/2023 4th commit. 
Fixed the issue when using the Admin login. Now everything works as expected. 
Started the design for the "Back office" view used for the admin. (not finished). 


04/05/2023 3rd commit. 
Fixed some errors, made it possible to login as different users using ASPnetIdentity ( That part is still not done yet, Have an issue when logging in as admin - gets access denied for some unclear reason, so ill need to fix that). 
Started on the ProductDetail-design and made it possible to click on different "products" and get to that product-id. 
Started on Admin view where its possible to add products ( Error when uploading image to database, gonna fix that too). 
Probably some more stuff ive forgot about. 
 
 
 
 
 20/04/2023 2nd commit. 
 Another school project by using MVC and MVVM, this is a E-commerse website, and also my first project using MVC and MVVM. 
 It contains a database to store products and user information. 
 Obviously the design isnt done yet and I will change alot of it. All links doesnt work yet either. 
 (The "details" link in the menu is only there to let me see the design of it as fast as possible). 
 Deadline for this project is may 28.
