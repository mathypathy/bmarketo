 Another school project by using MVC and MVVM, this is a E-commerse website, and also my first project using MVC and MVVM. 
 It contains a database to store products and user information. 
 Obviously the design isnt done yet and I will change alot of it. All links doesnt work yet either. 
 (The "details" link in the menu is only there to let me see the design of it as fast as possible). 
 Deadline for this project is may 28.
